## Bad UI/UX Challenge Entry - BuxStore

Visit for yourself: https://bux-store.vercel.app/

## Thought Process

Mostly because I'd be the one that would have to spend the most time looking at it, I didn't want to make anything that looked too horrendous, and after all, if someone were to visit the site, 
they would likely bounce straight away. What I needed was something that gave the expectation that it had been build with competence... when actually, it would be built with malice (no, that isn't a JS framework - probably).

As such, I decided to go with a simple little book store, hence the name 'Bux', and find ways to make it as obnoxious and annoying as possible.

The main 'theme' I went for was a sort of 'metered usage' or 'pay-as-you-go' type functionality where interacting with the site would cost you points, 
which you'd then have to earn. In this iteration, you do this by answering questions, but longer term this would ideally be some form of data-harvesting 
or human automation so that I could monetize the user base.

## 'Features'
- 'Metered usage' - you have to earn points to interact with the site. Once you run out, the products panel gets locked.
    - As part of this, product descriptions and prices are hidden and cost points to reveal.
    - To earn more points you have to answer questions but luckily these are pretty easy :)
- 'Shitty drop-downs' - does as it says on the tin.
- 'Increase Font Size' - it's important to be able to read the text, so I've added a button to increase the font size. It's not my fault if your screen is too small.
- 'Definitely Useful Sorting' - Sorting by price is generally pretty useful...generally...
- 'Intuitive Purchasing' - There is no obvious way to add to basket, this will help users consider their purchasing decisions.
- 'Enhanced VAT Pricing' - Users can find it useful to know the VAT or non-VAT price of an item, and they'll definitely get one of those.

## Backlog (that I'll never get around to doing)
- Any sort of mouse movement should cost points. Only on 'mouse stop though as I'd like to reward efficient mouse work.
- Another 'sort function that will sort all the images together, the descriptions together, etc. This will allow for easier comparison between products.
- A 'dark mode' button that will take users to a YouTube playlist of 'My Chemical Romance' songs.
- Install keylogger, crypto-miner and as many third-party trackers as possible.
  - The more data we have, the better placed we are to make informed decisions on site improvements.
- Launch actual BuxCoin cryptocurrency and integrate into site.
- All products to become NFTs that the users don't actually own.
